# MERN Shop
This project is basically divided into two part one is frontend and another is backend. However earlier I mentioned my work
process as well as achitecture. Now I implemented a simple SPA application using `ReactJS` and `ExpressJS` both are running 
on the `NodeJS` runtime. I did not user any mongoDB database here. On my next project I will use the MongoDB database too.

## Frontend Installation
For running this project, we need to run two project separetly from two different terminal. Lets start the frontend part 
first then we will run the backend part. Fronted is created with `ReactJS` and I added all the package into the `Package.json` file. Thus, we need to run some command for running this project, all of the commands are mentioned below :

At first we need to install the `NodeJs` into our machine. Then go the frontend folder. After navigating the frontend folder
simply type command into you `terminal` for Linux/ `command propmt` for windows user.

`npm install`

I command will download all of the node-modules package into our project. After that, run another command

`npm start`

Now we will see that our development server is running for frontend react into the port 3000 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
