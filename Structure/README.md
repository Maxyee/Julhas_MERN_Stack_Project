## Development Structure

Structure is one of the core element of any software development task. Without a perfect structure it is quite difficult to
work frequently. Although it is possible to make a software without structure, It is not the perfect way to make good software. As a result, I always try to use a structure before making any perfect software.

From the picture, I point out that how I will make any software by MERN stack development. To begin with, I will follow the MERN theory. Then I will make two project one for the frontend and another for the backend. Into the frontend section, ReactJS 
project will hold all of this elements into it. For instance, components, hooks, routing and other user validation. On the other hand, Into the backend section, I will make node server where ExpressJs framework will be created and the mongoDB database wil be connected with it. In this backend section, it will hold some elements on it such as REST API, Routes, Controllers, Models as well as backend user validation.
Finally, I will connect those two end (frontend + backend) after that I will test the file upload section and authentication.If all of the things is ok then i will deploy the software into the production server.
