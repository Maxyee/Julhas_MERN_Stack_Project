# Julhas_MERN_Stack_Project
In this repository, I will describe all the MERN Stack technology and my work process. How to connect all the technology
and how to make a project by using those technologies. I will also describe my knowledge in software development as well as 
how I understand and how I work with my self-learning. However, most of the javascript developer they have a lot of facination 
about working those MERN technologies because this the way they can learn the full-stack development in javascript. I have a lot
of fascination with those technologies too. As a result, I also learned that knowledge so that I can be a good developer in javascript MERN stack. I have a little bit of knowledge on C#, Python, and Java but I am trying to enrich my knowledge every day.

Let's start the main topic of this repository work on javascript. Here I mentioned the MERN Stack, It means the four core 
technologies used in javascript

1. MongoDB
2. ExpressJS
3. ReactJS
4. NodeJS

Af first I try to understand all of this four core elements by my own knowledge. I will describe one by one and after that
I will describe the structure about those elements. For instance, frontend, backend, Api, database, http request and so on.

From the picture, I have the idea of which technology is used for which work. MongoDB is a database solution, Express is a node
framework where I will write the logic for the API, React is a library of javascript for handing user in frontend side. Last but not
the least, NodeJs which is boss of all these technologies because it runs all of them.

At first, I will describe the database section. There are a lot database section in this programming
world such as SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB etc. Database can be categorized into two way one is SQL and another is NoSQL.

SQL database have relational tables where I used foreign key to coneect two tables. On the other hand, NoSQL database they do
not need those relational activity between tables. Most of the famous software is running on NOSQL database. On the contrary,
for this repository about MERN stack development, I will always work with the mongobd database which has the facility of NoSQL activities.
