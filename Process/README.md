## OverView

In this section, I will describe how I will do all of task and the work process. At first, I will create the `ReactJS` project where all of the UI of the software will be created. After that, I will break my UI template into diffirent components so that i can manipulate all of the UI data in different pages.

After finishing the UI task, I will create the API endpoints using `ExpressJS` . However, all of the logic and code will be 
implemented into the express project. In this section, I will write my project logic as well as authentication logic. In addition, when the API endpoint and the logic is created, i will format all the data into `JSON` format so that i can fetch those JSON data into my ReactJS project. Several Request will be made from the React project and the Express project will give
me the response by getting data from MongoDB database. This is the simple overview from my knowledge how I will do all of this
task.
